- **Dataset Link:** [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)

## Schema

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netflix;
CREATE TABLE netflix
(
    show_id      VARCHAR(5),
    type         VARCHAR(10),
    title        VARCHAR(250),
    director     VARCHAR(550),
    casts        VARCHAR(1050),
    country      VARCHAR(550),
    date_added   VARCHAR(55),
    release_year INT,
    rating       VARCHAR(15),
    duration     VARCHAR(15),
    listed_in    VARCHAR(250),
    description  VARCHAR(550)
);
```

## Business Problems and Solutions

### 1. Count the Number of Movies vs TV Shows

```sql
select 
count(*) filter(where type = 'Movie') as movie
,count(1) filter(where type = 'TV Show') as tvshow
from Netflix;
```

### 2. Find the Most Common Rating for Movies and TV Shows

```sql
select type, rating 
from 
		(select type, rating, count(1) cnt,
		 row_number() over(partition by type order by count(1) desc) rn
		from Netflix
		group by 1, 2 ) x
where x.rn =1;
```

### 3. List All Movies Released in a Specific Year (e.g., 2020)

```sql
select title 
from Netflix
where type = 'Movie' and release_year = 2020;
```

### 4. Find the Top 5 Countries with the Most Content on Netflix

select country, count(1) content
from 
		(select 
		unnest(string_to_array(country, ',')) country, show_id
		from Netflix) x 
group by 1
order by 2 desc
limit 5;
```

### 5. Identify the Longest Movie

```sql
select title,  substring(duration, 1,position ('m' in duration)-1)::int duration
from Netflix
where type = 'Movie' and duration is not null
order by 2 desc
limit 1;
```

### 6. Find Content Added in the Last 5 Years

```sql
select type, title, yr
from 
		(select type, title, substring(date_added, position(',' in date_added)+1)::numeric as yr
		from Netflix) x 
where yr between extract(year FROM current_date) - 5 AND extract(year FROM current_date)
;
```

### 7. Find All Movies/TV Shows by Director 'Rajiv Chilaka'

```sql
select type, title, director
from Netflix
where lower(director) ~ 'rajiv chilaka';
```


### 8. List All TV Shows with More Than 5 Seasons

select * 
from
		(select type, title, substring(duration, 1, position(' ' in duration))::int season
		from Netflix
		where type = 'TV Show') 
where season > 5;
```


### 9. Count the Number of Content Items in Each Genre

```sql
select *, count(1) cnt
from 
		(select trim(unnest(string_to_array(listed_in, ','))) content
		from Netflix) 
group by 1
order by 2 desc;
```


### 10.Find each year and the average numbers of content release in India on netflix. 
return top 5 year with highest avg content release!

```sql
with cte as 
        (select unnest(string_to_array(country, ',')) country, show_id, 
				 substring(date_added, position(',' in date_added)+1)::numeric as yr 
				 from Netflix)
select country, yr, count(1) cnt
, round((count(1)::decimal/(select count(1) from cte where country = 'India')*100),2) avg
from cte 
where country = 'India'
group by 1,2
order by avg desc 
limit 5;
```


### 11. List All Movies that are Documentaries

```sql
select * from 
	(select type, title, trim(unnest(string_to_array(listed_in, ','))) genra 
	from Netflix)
where genra = 'Documentaries';
```


### 12. Find All Content Without a Director

SELECT * 
FROM netflix
WHERE director IS NULL;

```


### 15. Categorize Content Based on the Presence of 'Kill' and 'Violence' Keywords

from
		(select description,
